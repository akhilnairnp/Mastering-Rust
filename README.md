# Mastering Rust
This is the code repository for [Mastering Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-rust?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885303), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
If concurrent programs are giving you sleepless nights, Rust is your go-to language. Being one of the first ever comprehensive books on Rust, it is filled with real-world examples and explanations, showing you how you can build scalable and reliable programs for your organization.

We’ll teach you intermediate to advanced level concepts that make Rust a great language. Improving performance, using generics, building macros, and working with threads are just some of the topics we’ll cover. We’ll talk about the official toolsets and ways to discover more. The book contains a mix of theory interspersed with hands-on tasks, so you acquire the skills as well as the knowledge. Since programming cannot be learned by just reading, we provide exercises (and solutions) to hammer the concepts in.

After reading this book, you will be able to implement Rust for your enterprise project, deploy the software, and will know the best practices of coding in Rust.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter01.



The code will look like the following:
```
> rustc -o main main.rs
> ./main
